# knight-travails

My "Knight travails" project (The Odin Project, JavaScript Path).

In this project I built a function "knightMoves" that shows the shortest possible way a knight can get from one square on the chessboard to another by outputting all the squares it will stop on along the way.

To test this function you need to open console and type knightMoves(a,b), where a is the square the knight starts from (for example [0,0]) and b is the square it should end up on (for example [7,7]). So you can type something like this knightMoves([1,3],[5,6]).
